🔐 What is Encapsulation in OOP?
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit — usually a class. It also means restricting direct access to some of the class’s internal data — protecting the object’s state.

✅ Goals of Encapsulation
Protect data from unwanted changes

Hide internal implementation (data hiding)

Control how data is accessed/modified

Improve modularity and maintainability

🧱 Encapsulation in Dart (How it works)
In Dart:

A variable or method is private if its name starts with an underscore _.

Access is restricted to within the same file (not just the class).





🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of a vending machine:

You don’t see or touch the internal system

You just press buttons (public methods) to operate it

The machine internally handles everything securely (private data)
