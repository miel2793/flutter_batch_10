///

Overriding means redefining a method in the child class that already exists in the parent class.

It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is
already defined in its superclass.

âœ… Rules of Overriding in Dart:
Method name must be the same.

Method signature (parameters) must be the same.

Use the @override annotation for clarity (not mandatory, but recommended).

The child class must extend or implement the parent class.*/
